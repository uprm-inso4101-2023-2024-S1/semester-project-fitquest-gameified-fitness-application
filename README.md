## Development Guidelines
- Always create a new branch for any feature not matter the size.
- To merge the changes create a pull request that will be verified by the team leader and other members.
- Create pull requests merging to the beta branch.
- Use descriptive titles for the commits and PRs. Write brief descriptions on the PRs of the changes made.
- **Never commit changes directly to main.**
