/**
 * A performant interface for rendering sectioned lists, supporting the most handy features:
 *
 *  - Fully cross-platform.
 *  - Configurable viewability callbacks.
 *  - List header support.
 *  - List footer support.
 *  - Item separator support.
 *  - Section header support.
 *  - Section separator support.
 *  - Heterogeneous data and item rendering support.
 *  - Pull to Refresh.
 *  - Scroll loading.
 *
 * If you don't need section support and want a simpler interface, use
 * [`<FlatList>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).
 *
 * Simple Examples:
 *
 *     <SectionList
 *       renderItem={({item}) => <ListItem title={item} />}
 *       renderSectionHeader={({section}) => <Header title={section.title} />}
 *       sections={[ // homogeneous rendering between sections
 *         {data: [...], title: ...},
 *         {data: [...], title: ...},
 *         {data: [...], title: ...},
 *       ]}
 *     />
 *
 *     <SectionList
 *       sections={[ // heterogeneous rendering between sections
 *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},
 *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},
 *         {data: [...], renderItem: ...},
 *       ]}
 *     />
 *
 * This is a convenience wrapper around [`<VirtualizedList>`](docs/virtualizedlist),
 * and thus inherits its props (as well as those of `ScrollView`) that aren't explicitly listed
 * here, along with the following caveats:
 *
 * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all
 *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.
 * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-
 *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop
 *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on
 *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.
 * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously
 *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see
 *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,
 *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.
 * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.
 *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.
